This repository serves as a collection of tickets and topics of interest on a select set of Apache
Software Foundation projects. This repository will also serve as place for myself to make notes on
how software is developed in the ASF as well as the different software engineering models and
approaches I come across. Furthermore, notes will be made on how each technology works to better
improve my understanding of the various Apache projects.

## ASF Overview

<!--History of ASF here -->

_The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is an American non-profit corporation (classified as
a 501(c) organization in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the
Apache HTTP Server. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated on March 25, 1999._

_The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software
they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is free and open-source
software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based
development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a
self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a
meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have
actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source
organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in._

_Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache
projects; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without
permission._ -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation)

_The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related
technology._

in an Apache Software project.
