This repository serves as a collection of tickets and topics of interest on a select set of Apache
Software Foundation projects. This repository will also serve as place for myself to make notes on
how software is developed in the ASF as well as the different software engineering models and
approaches I come across. Furthermore, notes will be made on how each technology works to better
improve my understanding of the various Apache projects.
